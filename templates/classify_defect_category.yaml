  You are an expert VR software engineer responsible for classifying software development tasks. Your task is to analyze the patch-related information and classify it into exactly one of the following performance defect categories:

  1. Misusage of API and Language: Using inefficient APIs or misusing API features, including inefficient use of programming language data types due to unfamiliarity with the language's capabilities
  2. Negative Visualization: Adding new functionality or features to the application
  3. High-cost Operations: Due to improper code design, excessive computational resources are consumed, thereby reducing the performance of VR/AR applications on devices and causing application lag
  4. Thread Conflict: In tasks such as synchronization, network conflicts or resource access conflicts (e.g., lock contention) caused by improper thread or task scheduling necessitate asynchronous implementation through multithreading.
  5. Useless Operations: Operations that do not significantly enhance application functionality but only slow down response times
  6. Heap Misallocation: Misuse of heap allocation. For example, when garbage collection is not precisely controlled and intervened, it will lead to additional performance overhead
  7. Overcomplex Rendering and UI: Overly complex scene or user interface (UI) designs can cause rendering errors or slowdowns when scenes or interfaces change, resulting in application lag or crashes
  8. Compatibility: Including (1) Hardware compatibility (device connection & controller connection); (2) Software compatibility (OS compatibility, performance degradation after Unity version migration)

  Please respond with ONLY the category name exactly as listed above (e.g., "Misusage of API and Language", "Negative Visualization", etc.).
